## What I'm doing right now

I was working as a Freelancer on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~0135faad7cc004c7eb/), **BUT** right now I don't have much time to work as freelancer.

## My Side Projects

I done these Projects in my free time and I published most of them as an Open source projects in github


### Anonymous Feedback Application

this just a [dead simple feedback web application](https://github.com/shekohex/dead-simple-feedback-app) was for me 
to get some feedbacks from my friends or coworkers, but then I post it as an open source project.
I just want to build something simple and fast , so I used vanila javascript with [Expressjs](expressjs.com) as a back-end framework
and for the front-end i used [Bulma](https://bulma.io) as a beautiful, simple but powerful css framework.

In this project i want to keep every thing simple as posible, so anyone can understand it.
you could see a live version of it [here](https://dead-simple-feedback.herokuapp.com/). don't forget to leave me a feedback :heart:

### Tweet about Me

[Tweet about Me](https://github.com/shekohex/twt-about-me), You guessed it :smiley: , it was another crazy idea.

a twitter bot :bird: that receives a DM from you and make a tweet about it.
If you want to send a message to someone just send a message followed by his/her username and let the bot make the rest.
the bot take the message from you containing the @username, then he will make a tweet with your message and mention that user in the tweet *without mentioning who seends this message* :smiley: 
I used [Twit](https://github.com/ttezel/twit) -*Twitter API Client for node (REST & Streaming API)*- to help me working with twitter api and also this project is written in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Blockchain :link:

Simple [Blockchain](https://github.com/shekohex/blockchain) Mechanism in [Typescript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) for Learning Purpose and to demonstrate the basics of blockchains.
I was lerning how the cryptocurrency works and how it be exist, so I learned block chains and how it useful as it's the core of all cryptocurrencies out there. 

I also have rewrite this project in another languages: [Go lang](https://gist.github.com/shekohex/9da2c116ca2a1209c5851f955bd24a6c) and [Dart](https://gist.github.com/shekohex/3aef759074ad9fcb31fe0f772c8f8fb4) .


### Jax: :fire: minimal C-interpreter

[jax](https://github.com/shekohex/jax) is minimal C-interpreter to play with. and desinged for learning purpose
I was heedful about how compilers/interpreters works What's a VM ? Bytecode! :open_mouth:.
All these question comes to my head, and i decided to write a VM and an interpreter.
So I chosed the C language for the simplacity. the code base is well documented and i also included some useful links to get you start up and build your own.
