I'm working as a Freelancer on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~0135faad7cc004c7eb/), **BUT** Iâ€™m currently not have much time to work as freelancer right now.

## My Side Projects

I done these Projects in my free time and I published most of them as an Open source projects in github


### Anonymous Feedback Application

this just a [dead simple feedback web application](https://github.com/shekohex/dead-simple-feedback-app) was for me 
to get some feedbacks from my friends or coworkers, but then I post it as an open source project.
I just want to build something simple and fast , so I used vanila javascript with [Expressjs](expressjs.com) as a back-end framework
and for the front-end i used [Bulma](https://bulma.io) as a beautiful, simple but powerful css framework.

In this project i want to keep every thing simple as posible, so anyone can understand it.
you could see a live version of it [here](https://dead-simple-feedback.herokuapp.com/). don't forget to leave me a feedback :heart:
